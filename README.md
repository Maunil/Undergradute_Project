22 Shruti Synthesizer

Members: Maunil Vyas, Deep Patel, Shreyas Patel

The usual electronic synthesisers use 12 notes in an octave. However, Indian classical musicians required "22 Shruti (Notes)" in an Octave. Thus, in most cases, musicians have to take support from an external entity to tune their instruments. With this in a view, an initiative is taken to build a "22 Shruti Synthesizers", having a capability of generating all  22 Notes (In Indian classical music, Shrutis are refereed as musical Notes).

Progress: Till now, we have successfully implemented a software version of the synthesizer on Scilab. It is capable of generating 22 different sound tones of having a facility of 22 different notes.  However, the sound quality is not reasonable for musicians, and that is why we are seeking an alternative approach to synthesis perfect sound using Autoencoders and other Deep learning techniques. Additionally, we are working on the stand-alone part too.

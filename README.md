## 1). 22 Shrutis Synthesizer
**Members : Deep C. Patel, Maunil Vyas, Shreyas Patel, Prof. Ashok Ranade**<br>
The usual electronic synthesisers use 12 notes in an octave. However, Indian classical musicians are fastidious about minor frequency variations, and therefore prefer  "22 Shruti (Notes)" in an octave. Thus, in most cases, musicians have to take support from an external entity to tune their instruments as there is an absence of such electronic synthesisers in the market. With this in a view, an initiative is taken to build a "22 Shruti Synthesizers", having a capability of generating 22 Notes. 
(In Indian classical music, Shruti is jargon for a musical note)
<br>
Progress: Till now, we have successfully implemented a software version of the synthesiser on Scilab and in Python. It is capable of generating 22 different sound tones of having a facility of 22 different notes.  We have created two versions of the synthesiser. The first version synthesises the frequencies using re-sampling of the recorded sound note, and in the second version, we synthesised frequencies using additive synthesis. We analysed primary frequency components of the instrument tone using Fourier Transform and added their harmonics to synthesise various frequencies. 
However, the sound quality is not reasonable for musicians, and that is why we are seeking an alternative approach to synthesis perfect sound using Autoencoders and other Deep learning techniques. Apart from this, we are also working also working to create a standalone synthesiser using RaspberryPi and MIDI Keyboard.

In this project we tried to reproduce the paper titled ["A nonparametric approach for spectrum sensing using bootstrap techniques"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7036915/).

## 3). Analysis of Traditional CPU Scheduling Algorithms and Real Time CPU Scheduling Algorithms
**Members : Maunil Vyas, Deep C. Patel, Shreyas Patel, Karan Patel**<br>
**Course : Operating Systems**<br>
In this project we have done analysis on the Traditional CPU Scheduling algorithms like First Come First Serve(FCFS), Shortest
Remaining Next(SRN), Round Robin(RR), Priority Scheduling(PS) as well as Real Time CPU Scheduling Algorithms like Rate Monotonic Scheduling(RMS) and Earliest Deadline First(EDF) algorithms. We analyzed and compared characteristics like Average Waiting Time, Average Turnaround Time, Throughput and Percentage of Deadlines Missed.

## 4). Delta Search Machine : Desktop File Search Engine
**Members : Deep C. Patel, Maunil Vyas, Shreyas Patel, Jay Dangar**<br>
**Course : Data Structures and Algorithms**<br>
We made a desktop file searching using Java. We perform serch on the index of the files in the Desktop. For the indexing task, we utilized inverted index. Our Searching engine features GUI, Search History, Recommendations and Spell Corrections.

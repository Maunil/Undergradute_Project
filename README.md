**Abstract:**
Spectrum sensing is a key aspect of Cognitive Radio (CR). 
The main requirement in CR systems is the ability to sense the primary signal 
accurately and rapidly. In this paper, a novel hybrid spectrum sensing scheme in 
CR is proposed which considers the hypothesis problem as a binary classification problem. 
The proposed scheme is a combination of classical energy detection, Likelihood Ratio Test statistic (LRS-G^2) 
and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The scheme utilises energy from energy detection and Zhang test statistic
from LRS-G^2 as features to train the ANN while ANN provides the adaptive learning and stable performance to the scheme. 
The performance of proposed sensing scheme is evaluated on several real-world primary signals of various radio technologies, 
and it has been found out that for all those radio technologies the proposed scheme outperforms the classical energy detection 
and the improved energy detection.

## 2). 22 Shrutis Synthesizer

**Motivation:**
The usual electronic synthesisers use 12 notes in an octave. However, Indian classical musicians are fastidious about minor frequency variations, and therefore prefer  "22 Shruti (Notes)" in an octave. Thus, in most cases, musicians have to take support from an external entity to tune their instruments as there is an absence of such electronic synthesisers in the market. With this in a view, an initiative is taken to build a "22 Shruti Synthesizers", having a capability of generating 22 Notes. 
(In Indian classical music, Shruti is jargon for a musical note)
<br><br>
**Progress:** 
Till now, we have successfully implemented a software version of the synthesizer on Scilab and in Python. It is capable of generating 22 different sound tones of having a facility of 22 different notes. We have created two versions of the synthesizer. The first version synthesizes the frequencies using re-sampling of the recorded sound note, and in the second version, we synthesized frequencies using additive synthesis, where we analyzed the primary frequency components of the instrument tone using Fourier Transform and added their harmonics to get a tone, after that we used mechanisms such as Attack, sustain and release to shape the tone envelops to make it more similar to the actual sound tone characteristics.
However, the sound quality is not reasonable for musicians, and that is why we are seeking an alternative approach to synthesis  adequate sound using Autoencoders and other Deep learning techniques such as NSynth: Neural Audio Synthesis. Apart from this, we also received a fund from our institute to make a standalone synthesizer product and thus in parallel currently working on RaspberryPi and MIDI Keyboards too.

## 3). GAN + PPCA

**Abstract:**
First introduced by I. Goodfellow in 2014, GAN has
become one of the hot topics in the fields of Machine Learning
and Artificial Intelligence. In this work, we demonstrate three
approaches for image generation: Deep Convolutional GAN
(DCGAN)- The original GAN model, and then our approach to incorporate Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) into GAN to make the training faster. We also try to introduce KMean clustering on generalised datasets, to improve the quality of datasets used in training the GAN. Our motive in this project has been to improve the speed factor of the Neural Networks with making it less computationally expensive. The results obtained are good, but still, far from desired.

## 4). Human Height Estimation
**Members : [Deep C. Patel](https://github.com/deepcpatel), Maunil Vyas, Aashima Yuthika, Divya Patel**<br>
**Course : Computer Vision**<br>
**Abstract:** 
Surveillance cameras are omnipresent in today’s
world. This has a lot of advantages especially, in
finding individuals for a variety of reasons. Use of hard
biometrics for person identification is accurate but
intrusive. Due to this reason, soft biometrics has gained
a lot of popularity. In this project, we explore the height
of a person as a soft biometric feature for identification.
We are dividing the height of people into three categories
– short, medium and tall. The estimation is done using a
calibration matrix and detecting the person in the video
sequence.

**Course : Wireless Communications**<br>
We tried to reproduce results of the paper titled 
["A nonparametric approach for spectrum sensing using bootstrap techniques"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7036915/).

In this project, we have analysed the Traditional CPU Scheduling algorithms such as  
First Come First Serve(FCFS), Shortest Remaining Next(SRN), Round Robin(RR), Priority Scheduling(PS)
as well as Real-Time CPU Scheduling Algorithms like Rate Monotonic Scheduling(RMS) and Earliest Deadline First(EDF) 
algorithms. Additionally, We have compared primary characteristics of the mentioned algorithms like Average Waiting Time, 
Average Turnaround Time, Throughput and Percentage of Deadlines Missed.
